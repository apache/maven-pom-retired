bad.key.id=bad hex key id: {0}

no.secret.key=no secret key {0} in the specified keyring
no.public.key=no public key {0} in the specified keyring

null.private.key=supplied key cannot be null

null.verify.signature=out of sequence call to verify signature: verifier has not been initialized yet

bad.verify.signature.state=out of sequence call to produce signature: verifier has not been initialized yet

no.signatures.in.stream=no signatures found in the input streamn
no.objects.in.stream=no pgp objects found in the input streamn

bad.factory.init.verify=cannot initialize signature verification factory without trusted ring
bad.factory.init.verify.empty=trusted ring read in is null, cannot proceed
bad.factory.init.generate=cannot initialize signature generation factory without secret key

no.stream.processor=neither signature generator nor signature verifier has been initialized. Don't know what to do.
